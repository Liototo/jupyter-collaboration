This **Real Time Collaboration** monorepo contains current work on Real Time collaboration for use in JupyterLab and other Jupyter applications.

## Project Meetings

We have a `bi-weekly` meeting call. Please come and join [on Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/94702599683)! All are welcome to come and just listen or discuss any work related to this project.

For the time, place and notes, see [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@_4xc7QhhSHKODRQn1uiulw/BkV24I3qL/edit).

Meetings are also recorded and available on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUrHeD2K9Cmk5PpU7a3Pf5zEteJ-_kA81).

We also use [the same HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@_4xc7QhhSHKODRQn1uiulw/BkV24I3qL/edit) to set an agenda and to capture notes for these meetings.

## Learning Pathway

We are striving to keep meetings productive and on topic. If you are joining
us for the first time or need a refresher about the project's scope, we recommend reading the following documents.

- The [Specification](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/spec.html): We are working on creating a living specification for the protocol(s) created here. We're doing our best but it may not always be totally in sync with explorations in the repo, until they are settled on.
- The [Design](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/design.html) document.
- The [Architecture](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/architecture.html) document.
- Vision as explained in the [grant proposal for CZI](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/organisation/czi-2020.html).
